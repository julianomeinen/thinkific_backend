### Assumptions made
Use this section to tell us about any assumptions that you made when creating your solution.
### Shortcuts/Compromises made
I could have structured the code better with a scalable architecture. I did the best I could with the time I had.
### Stretch goals attempted
1. Deploy your API and include the link in your README so we can try it out without having to run it.
- Goal achieved!
- I developed with a complete Continuous Integration architecture with GitHub and Heroku.
- It means that if I commit and Push the master branch to GitHub the deployment to the production environment will be automatic.
2. Build a UI for the service, especially the account creation functionality
- Goal achieved!
- A simple login page was created with HTML, Bootstrap and Ajax.
3. Allow sign up using OAuth
- Goal achieved!
- You can login with Google account. Add Facebook ou Github it's easy, but I didn't because of time designation.
### Instructions to run assignment locally
Option 1: Just access https://thinkificfrontend.herokuapp.com.
Option 2: You can run the app locally if you want. Just clone the repository and run it with Node JS.
Option 3: You can use a software like Postman to do the POST and GET requests for tests.
### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?
- Frontend MVC: because of the time I couldn't build.
- Facebook and GitHub login: because of the time I couldn't build.
- Tests: I didn't have enough time to create the automatic tests.

### Your feedback on this technical challenge
I think it could be a nice challenge to code a simple CRUD with SQL and NoSQL.
